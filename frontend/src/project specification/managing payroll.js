Managing payments and payrolls: The MIS should have the capability to
 manage the payments and payrolls of beneficiaries, including the 
 disbursement of funds and the tracking of payments. This can be 
 done through the use of a digital payment platform, which allows for 
 the easy transfer of funds to beneficiaries and the tracking of payments made.
  
Sure! Here is a sample functional React component that manages 
payments and payrolls using a digital payment platform:


*/}



import React from 'react';
import './PaymentManager.css';

const PaymentManager = () => {
  // Declare state variables for storing payment and payroll information
  const [payments, setPayments] = useState([]);
  const [payrolls, setPayrolls] = useState([]);

  // Function for disbursing funds to a beneficiary
  const disburseFunds = (beneficiaryId, amount) => {
    // Use digital payment platform to transfer funds to beneficiary
    // Update payments state with new payment information
    setPayments([...payments, {beneficiaryId, amount}]);
  }

  // Function for tracking payments made to beneficiaries
  const trackPayments = () => {
    // Use digital payment platform to retrieve payment history
    // Update payments state with payment history
    setPayments(paymentHistory);
  }

  // Function for calculating and disbursing payroll to employees
  const processPayroll = () => {
    // Calculate payroll amounts for each employee
    const payrollAmounts = calculatePayroll();
    // Use digital payment platform to transfer payroll funds to employees
    // Update payrolls state with new payroll information
    setPayrolls([...payrolls, {payrollAmounts}]);
  }

  return (
    <div className="PaymentManager">
      <h1>Payment Manager</h1>
      <button onClick={() => disburseFunds(beneficiaryId, amount)}>Disburse Funds</button>
      <button onClick={() => trackPayments()}>Track Payments</button>
      <button onClick={() => processPayroll()}>Process Payroll</button>
      <div className="payment-history">
        <h2>Payment History</h2>
        {payments.map(payment => (
          <div key={payment.beneficiaryId}>
            <p>Beneficiary ID: {payment.beneficiaryId}</p>
            <p>Amount: {payment.amount}</p>
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
      <div className="payroll-history">
        <h2>Payroll History</h2>
        {payrolls.map(payroll => (
          <div key={payroll.timestamp}>
            <p>Timestamp: {payroll.timestamp}</p>
            {Object.entries(payroll.payrollAmounts).map(([employeeId, amount]) => (
              <div key={employeeId}>
                <p>Employee ID: {employeeId}</p>
                <p>Payroll Amount: {amount}</p>
              </div>
            ))}
          </div>
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default PaymentManager;







{/*


.PaymentManager {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

.PaymentManager button {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
