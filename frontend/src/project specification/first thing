The MIS is expected to cover the following processes of the social protection system: 
•	Identification and registration through linkage with the State Social Register (SSR) or an on-demand method of data collection
•	Eligibility determination and enrolment process
•	Continuous maintenance of beneficiary register
•	Authentication and compliance monitoring
•	Managing payments and payrolls of beneficiaries
•	Managing grievances and appeals
•	Monitoring and Evaluation 
•	Support on-going management and planning 



Solution

This can be done through the creation of a digital registration platform that is linked to the State Social Register (SSR). This platform can be used for on-demand data collection, allowing individuals to self-register for social protection benefits. The platform should also have the capability to verify the identity of the individuals registering, to ensure that only eligible individuals are able to access the benefits.
please, create a react component for the information above


Here is a example of a React component that implements a digital registration platform for social protection benefits, based on the description provided:




import React, { useState } from 'react';

const DigitalRegistration = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');
  const [ssr, setSsr] = useState('');
  const [error, setError] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    if (!name || !ssr) {
      setError('Please enter your name and SSR number');
      return;
    }

    // Implement verification of identity and registration here
    // Use name and ssr variables to access user input
    // Update the SSR and show a success message if registration is successful
    // Show an error message if registration fails
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      {error && <p className="error">{error}</p>}
      <label>
        Name:
        <input type="text" value={name} onChange={(event) => setName(event.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <br />
      <label>
        State Social Register (SSR) number:
        <input type="text" value={ssr} onChange={(event) => setSsr(event.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <br />
      <button type="submit">Register</button>
    </form>
  );
};

export default DigitalRegistration;
